# Webcam-Motion-Detector

It is a webcam motion detector application that detects any kind of movement in the camera frame and once the camera is closed, it also plots the time graph displaying the different time slots in which the objects were detected while the camera streamed. 

Instead of the webcam camera, other external cameras can also be used for this project.

Libraries: cv2 (detect the moving object in the video), pandas (create and update data frames), Bokeh

Example of plotting:
